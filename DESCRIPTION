Description: One of the goals of the Human Brain Project is to create a platform
    that will enable scientists to search for new biologically and clinically
    meaningful discoveries by making use of a large database of neurological
    data enlisted from many hospitals. One challange is that while patients are
    diagnosed, there is a widespread concern that their diagnosis may be too wide
    and ambiguous, and thus hides important scientific information. TAU team offered
    a strategy, named '3C-strategy': Categorization, Clustering, Classification. The
    3C strategy is designed for a medical research, which combines supervised and
    unsupervised learning leading to refining the diagnosed diseases to clinically
    relevant classes.
